BetterCMDTab is a app for MacOS that transitions your **CMD+Tab** experience to show window previews and the window name when **CMD+tabbing.**
The app is currently in progress and on the starting stage. You can follow along on the **roadmap** and every single change and can catch me inside the ! [Discord server for the app.
